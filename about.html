        <h2>Our Mission</h2>
        <p class="intro">
            Iron Dad is dedicated to showing that single fathers can create complete, loving families.
        </p>
        <p>
            We share stories of fathers who balance work, parenting, and personal life while providing
            a strong foundation for their children. Our goal is to inspire, support, and give visibility
            to these everyday heroes.
        </p>
        <p>
            Being a single dad doesn’t mean struggling alone — it means adapting, learning, and showing
            love in every action.

        <h2>Why This Matters</h2>
        <p>
            Society often focuses on mothers in parenting, but fathers play an equally important role.
            Highlighting single fathers helps break stereotypes and provides support for dads everywhere.
